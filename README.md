## So, what's a Smylest?
**Smylest** | /Smile-lest/ | _noun._ <br>
_A hero who makes the world a better place fashioning one smile at a time_

Everyone deserves a smile. But sometimes, it's not so easy to get one. Whether you're feeling great or looking for a 
confidence boost, Smylest is here to connect smile-bringers to smile-needers to save the day, one smile at a time.

As an Android app, Smylest empowers users to seek and share happiness quickly, easily, and anonymously. In the final 
product, requests for smiles and responses alike will be passed through a hate/harassment/profanity filter that automatically 
blocks inbound and outbound messages that would do more harm than good.

## Inspiration
Smylest rises from the belief that positive comments from those outside your friend group or family are the ones that resonate 
the most. So, in an effort to brighten a world so easy to become isolated and depressed in, Smylest aims to bring the power of 
concentrated happiness to your fingertips!

## What it does
_Feeling down or in need of a confidence-booster?_ Open the Smylest app to compose an anonymous message that anyone in the world 
(or targeted groups) may reply to, giving you a personalized response that'll make you go :D in a matter of minutes.

_Feeling great?_ Use that superpower! Become a Smylest for a day and browse anonymous smile requests that you may respond to, 
sharing the power of a :D. Making a positive impact has never been so easy!

## Hackathon Details:
### Made for UGA Hacks 9
**Theme:** Be the hero of your own story | **Competition Period:** 2/9/24, 7:00p - 2/11/24-8:00a

### Team:
-Just myself :D (Justin Brand)

### Tools Used:
-Languages: Kotlin, Java
-Frameworks: Jetpack Compose
-Software: Android Studio, Photoshop, Draw.io, MS Whiteboard

### Problems Overcame:
Despite having worked with the Jetpack Compose framework quite a bit in the past and through ACM@UGA's Open Source Project,
there was still a decent amount of unexplored features that were tough to work out at first. Particularly difficult at first for me
was handling navigation. I also spent a considerable amount of Saturday evening attempting to figure out Android's data storage methods
so I could allow my components to read/write data from files, but I shifted priorities when I exhausted all options, so a half-win if
you will(?).
