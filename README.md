## So, what's a Smylest?
**Smylest** | /Smile-lest/ | _noun._ <br>
_A hero who makes the world a better place fashioning one smile at a time_
<br><br>
Everyone deserves a smile. But sometimes, it's not so easy to get one. Whether you're feeling great or looking for a 
confidence boost, Smylest is here to connect smile-bringers to smile-needers to save the day, one smile at a time.
<br><br>
As an Android app, Smylest empowers users to seek and share happiness quickly, easily, and anonymously. In the final 
product, requests for smiles and responses alike will be passed through a hate/harassment/profanity filter that automatically 
blocks inbound and outbound messages that would do more harm than good.

## Inspiration
In a world where technology, stress, and hustle culture produce some of the highest rates of isolation and depression we've seen,
the power of a smile is too often overlooked. With all that time spent alone and technology an arm's reach away, why not bring
the power of smiles to you?
<br><br>
Smylest is born from the belief that positive comments from those outside your friend group or family are the ones that resonate
the most. As a mobile app that brings positive people straight to those who need it most, Smylest aims to combat the issues of 
loneliness and depression while providing a means for everyone, no matter who they are or how they feel, to feel a bit better 
and make the world a bit better, one smile at a time.

## What it does
_Feeling down?_ Open the Smylest app to compose an anonymous message that anyone in the world 
(or targeted groups) may reply to, giving you a personalized response that'll make you go :D in a matter of minutes.
<br><br>
_Feeling great?_ Use that superpower! Become a Smylest for a day and browse anonymous smile requests that you may respond to, 
sharing the power of a :D. Making a positive impact has never been so easy!

## Hackathon Details:
### Made for UGA Hacks 9
**Theme:** Be the hero of your own story | **Competition Period:** 2/9/24, 7:00p - 2/11/24, 8:00a

### Team:
-Just myself :D (Justin Brand)

### Tools Used:
-Languages: Kotlin, Java<br>
-Frameworks: Jetpack Compose<br>
-Software: Android Studio, Photoshop, Draw.io, MS Whiteboard

### Problems Overcame:
Despite having worked with the Jetpack Compose framework quite a bit in the past and through ACM@UGA's Open Source Project,
there was still a decent amount of unexplored features that were tough to work out at first. Particularly difficult at first for me
was handling navigation. I also spent a considerable amount of Saturday evening attempting to figure out Android's data storage methods
so I could allow my components to read/write data from files, but I shifted priorities when I exhausted all options, so a half-win if
you will(?).
